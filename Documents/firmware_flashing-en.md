# Fortitude60 Firmware Burning Instructions（Old Version）
These steps are requierd to prepare a MCU for the first time, or to reset it back to the factory settings. If you have bought a v1.0 Kit, the keymap and essential settings have already been written to the MCU, so please proceed with the normal burning instructions (v1.0 users can skip the EEPROM section.) 

These instructions assume you have the QMK Firmware build environment and a firmware burning application, such as AVRDude, installed on your computer.

## Burning the EEPROM
Due to the hardware limitations of the Foritude 60, you must burn separate EEPROMs for the left-hand and right-hand sides of the keyboard, to help identify the devices. After you have written the EEPROM once, you do not need to do it again every time you update the QMK firmware. 

You can find the files that you need to write to the EEPROM in the following location:   
``/qmk_firmware/quantum/split_common``  

This is the file for the left-hand side: ``eeprom-lefthand.eep``  
This is the file forthe right-hand side: ``eeprom-righthand.eep``

### Burning Instructions (Linux)
To put the MCU into Write Mode, when the LED on the chip starts blinking, create a short between the Reset (RST) and GND pins on the MCU using a pair of tweezers, then execute the following commands. (Note: Be careful not to accidentally touch the nearby 5V pin!)

Command for Left-Hand Side of Keyboard:
``avrdude -c avr109 -p m32u4 -P /dev/ttyS1 -U  eeprom:w:"./quantum/split_common/eeprom-lefthand.eep``

Command for Right-Hand Side of Keyboard:
``avrdude -c avr109 -p m32u4 -P /dev/ttyS1 -U  eeprom:w:"./quantum/split_common/eeprom-righthand.eep``

Note: For your installation, replace ``/dev/tty*`` with the serial port name that appears when you reset the MCU.

### Burning Instructions (Windows)
Use AVRDude (GUI-baseed app) according to the directions indicated here:

This will allow you to burn both QMK firmwares at the same time. 

## Burning the QMK Firmware
You can burn the QMK Firmware for the0 Fortitude 60 in the same manner as any other keyboard: 

``make fortitude60/rev1:default:avrdude``
